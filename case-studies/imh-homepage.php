			<p>We had decided to tackle this page to improve the user experience through new copy and an overall design update. Tasked as the lead, it would be up to me to improve the user experience. This case study is an overview of the work I did to get to my end goal. In the end, it took about 2 weeks to come up with a finalized design, and another few months to iterate a winning design.</p>

			<p>Using the whiteboard, I wrote out our target personas, created user stories, drew out user funnels, laid out content flows, mapped exit paths, and put my ideas up front and center.</p>
			<p>This allowed me to organize my ideas and data so that I can easily guide my team in our feedback meetings. In these meetings, I walked the team through user stories and guided them through various scenarios. This helped validate my ideas.</p>
