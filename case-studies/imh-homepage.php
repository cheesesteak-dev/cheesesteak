			<p>After sitting on the same design since 2007, we finally launched a redesigned website.</p>
			<p>With it brought an updated style guide, a fresh design, and of course a whole new experience. Also included was about 75% of the original copy throughout the site. What resulted was inconsistent experiences since the copy was not properly matching up with the new user flows.</p>
			<p>We had decided to tackle this page to improve the user experience through new copy and an overall design update.</p>
			<p>Tasked as the lead, it would be up to me to improve the user experience. This case study is an overview of the work I did to get to my end goal. In the end, it took about 2 weeks to come up with a finalized design, and another few months to iterate a winning design.</p>

			<p>Using the whiteboard, I wrote out our target personas, created user stories, drew out user funnels, laid out content flows, mapped exit paths, and put my ideas up front and center.</p>
			<p>This allowed me to organize my ideas and data so that I can easily guide my team in our feedback meetings. In these meetings, I walked the team through user stories and guided them through various scenarios. This helped validate my ideas.</p>
